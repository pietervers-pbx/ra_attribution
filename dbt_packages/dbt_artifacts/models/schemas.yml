  - name: fct_dbt__run_results
    description: Metadata for dbt run commands. This model is also the point of reference for others
      in the build process to enforce consistency. Most other models depend on this one to dictate which
      results have been received. By having this model upstream of the others it is forced to go first
      and therefore anything picked up by it, can then safely be assumed to exist in the downstream models.
      Anything which arrives after the materialisation of this model is prevented from appearing in the others
      using an inner join within the definition of all of them to prevent them showing any facts which
      arrive during a rebuild.
